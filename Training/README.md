# Changelog

## Changes from V1 to V2

- **Training Time**: Reduced by using automatic precision and by fixing the size of input image and turning off random flip.
- **Config File**: Refactored configurations for better readability

## Changes from V2 to V3

- **Optimizer**: Changed from `SGD with Momentum` to `Adam`.
- **Base Learning Rate**: Set to `0.0001`from `0.0025`

## Changes from V3 to V4

- **Optimizer**: Changed from `Adam` to `AdamW`.
- **Base Learning Rate**: Set to `0.0001`.

## Changes from V4 to V5

- **Pre Trained Model**:  Mask R-CNN ResNeXt-101 (32x8d) FPN
- **Optimizer**: Changed to `Adam`.
- **Base Learning Rate**: Set to `0.0001`.

## Changes from V5 to V6

- **Pre Trained Model**: Mask R-CNN ResNet-101 FPN
- **Image Batch Size**: Set to 32

## Changes from V6 to V7

- **Image Batch Size**: Set to 64

## Note

All versions after V7 will use a different annotation file generated by [PreProcessing/MaskToAnnotationsV2.ipynb](PreProcessing/MaskToAnnotationsV2.ipynb), which only includes the annotations where the area is greater than 0. This change reduced the number of input images from 8593 to 7251. As a result, the comparison of results from the previous versions is a bit biased. From now on, only the results of the following versions will be considered.

## V8

- **Image Batch Size**: Set to 32
